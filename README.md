# 🐣 Flutter-Practice

🐔 A monorepo of Flutter projects for practice from a bunch of tutorials I've watched.

I completely believe in "Learn-by-doing" so the more projects I try to copy, the better experience I get. (Obviously with a sprinkle of effort).

### ✨ Apps made so far:

> Click on the folder for each app to see a demo gif of each.

1. **Salon Booking** - teaches about Onboarding, Carousel.
2. **Calculator App** - Made this on my own, used a math parser library, created the UI from scratch, and figured out how to structure and organize folders in a Flutter project for faster development like I do with React (for styles especially).
3. **WhatsApp UI** - teaches about ListTiles, Tabs, TabViews, and a bunch of cool premade Material stuff.
